# Computer-Vision Based Steering Wheel Angle Determination
A project, created in course DIT638 Cyberphysical Systems. The core of the project is an algorithm, developed to analyse a video-feed and determining steering wheel angles for a self-driving vehicle. These are used to avoid yellow and blue cones on a race track. The project runs in a Docker container and can be installed on a car-model.

This project was devevloped on Gitlab and then transfered to Github

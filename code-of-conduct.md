**How do we plan to collaborate?**

*Tools used to collaborate:*
* Discord meetings
* Google Drive documents
* WhatsApp group
* Gitlab
* Trello board in Scrumban Style
* Visual Studio Live Share
* Shared Google calendar

*Project Planning:*
\
\
We will use Scrum, supported by the Trello board in Scrumban Style. \
Each sprint iteration will last 2 weeks. The team will be led by another member of the team for each of the sprints, to assure that everyone gets a chance to improve their leadership skills.\
For tracking we will use labels on the trello board, connecting user stories to the sprints they will be completed in. If a task should be in need of more time than originally estimated, it will be prolonged to another sprint. Furthermore we will use IDs to connect requirements and epics/user stories. <br>
Every standup meeting (held before the lectures and before the collaborative sessions) we will conduct a retrospective.<br>



*Meeting Plan:*
* Collaborative session every Wednesday (10:00) and Friday (10:00)
* Duration will vary (minimum till 12:00)
* Tuesday 12:45 standup meeting
* Thursday 12:45 standup meeting
* We will have virtual fika breaks


*Meeting Template:*
* Attending : Attendees of the meeting
* Retrospective: What have we done from a previous meeting until the current meeting, whether there any impediments and what are we planning to do next
* Meeting Time : The time duration of the meeting
* Agenda: Points that are supposed to be worked at during the following worksession or individual time
* Decision: Decisions that the team has agreed upon which will last until the end of the project

The duration of the meeting is set in the beginning of the meeting, depending on the assumed duration that will be needed. This is supposed to keep the participants focused on the subjects. If the need shall arise, a meeting can be prolonged. 

\
**Risk management:**
\
First and foremost the team agrees that communication is key. When a task is in risk of delay, this has to be discussed as soon as possible. If a task should be delayed, this has to be communicated immediately by the responsible team-member and the other members will join in to solve the task in order to finish it in time. In case the team is not able to solve the task, the TAs or the teacher has to be involved in time, to avoid missing a deadline. 

\
**How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?**
\
We are planning on using Visual Studio Live Share to conduct real-time virtual pair programming. This can happen in teams of any size. If there are enough tasks for every team member to work individually in a sprint, they will be assigned accordingly, however, when there is need for help or there are team-tasks, Live Share is the tool of choice. 

*Tools used to inform:*
* Trello board with check lists in the individual assignments
* Retrospectives in the standup meetings and the collaborative sessions

\
**How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?**
* Good commit messages
* Good code comments
* Regular communication (collaborative sessions and standup meetings)

\
**What is our usual communication plan?**
\
Communicate as often as possible to ensure that every team member is up to date using our communication channels mentioned above. 

\
**How will we solve conflicts?**

*Policies, procedures and consequences :*
In this context, absence from a meeting means that the member is not participating without having informed his teammates
* If a member is absent from a meeting without any specific reason
* In this context, absence from a meeting means that the member is not participating without having informed his teammates
* We try to contact the member until the next meeting
* If a member misses 2 meetings consecutively without valid excuse the teacher will be informed and asked for a verdict and guidance to solve the problem
* In case we have conflict that we can’t solve between team members, the teacher will be involved and asked to be a mediator in a virtual meeting that will be scheduled


*If a member is not delivering the work he was assigned:*
* A chance to justify this will be given
* If it happens twice the teacher will be informed

If a member is late for a meeting (15 minutes buffer, the member has to keep the other
members informed) we will contact the member.
Everything that exceeds this amount has to be properly explained. If this happens in an abnormal pattern, the other members will decide how to proceed with a majority vote.


**Code quality** <br>
If a member makes changes that other members don’t agree on, the commitments can be changed/removed via a majority vote (if 50/50 we use google coin toss and shared screen for decision).


**Coding conventions:** <br>
* brackets right after function declaration “ for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { “
* space before parentheses 
* indentation : 4 spaces 
* naming : camel case 
* 1 space between functions
* descriptive variable and function names


If there arises a need for a change in the code of conduct, it can be inserted via majority vote (if 50/50 we use google coin toss and shared screen for decision)
